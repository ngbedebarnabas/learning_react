# ReactJs Learning Demo Apps
This repo contains my React practice projects (some built coding along while taking a course and others built on my own, like friends-list ). Each demo lives in its own branch.

## Demos
- **main**: Travel list, helps you list what you need for your travel, see what you've packed and what's left to pack.
- **eat-n-split**: Simple friendship app to track payments of meals when you go out together.
- **friends-list**: A simple app to meet with friends, add new friends and see friends skill sets.
- **pizza-menu**: A display of pizza menu to choose from.

To run a demo:
1. Clone the repo: `git clone [url]`
2. Checkout the branch: `git checkout [branch-name]`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the app: `npm start`
